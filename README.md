# Anki-Def-Updater
This is my attemp to make my anki cards better, by choosing which definitions from a dictionary, based on the most recent note added.

You'll need a folder named "Dicitonaries" that contains the unzipped folder "大辞林"

Top Button functions:

"Last Note" - Uses AnkiConnect to get the most recent note, get the word in the "focus" field and searches jp definitions in 大辞林 and displays the results.

"CLipboard" - Copies what's in the clipboard and pastes it in the box.

"Search" - Does nothing at the moment. The idea is to make it search the dictionary when you have a word in the clipboard box.

"Exit" - Closes the program. Why not?


It still does not add the selected definitions into anki. But that is the plan.
